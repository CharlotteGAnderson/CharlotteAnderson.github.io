title: Week 2 (6/24 - 6/30)
---


This week I expanded the initial network configuration by adding more nodes and enhancing the connectivity between them. This process involved integrating new technologies and optimizing the existing network structure to improve performance. To ensure the updated network met all project requirements, I had a detailed meeting with Dr. Siasi. During this meeting, we reviewed the current configuration, discussed potential improvements, and outlined the next steps for further development. Dr. Siasi provided valuable insights and feedback, which I incorporated into the updated network design. This collaborative effort resulted in a larger and more efficient network that aligned closely with our project goals.
