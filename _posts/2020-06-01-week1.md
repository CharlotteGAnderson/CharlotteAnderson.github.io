title: Week 1 (6/17 - 6/23)
---

During my first week on this project, I began laying the foundational pieces. My initial task was to develop a network configuration with 10 nodes, each equipped with 100 CPUs, and edges with a bandwidth of 100. I generated random inputs specifying starting nodes, end nodes, bandwidth requirements, and functions to be solved (one function per node). Once the network was set up, I ensured that each function followed the optimal path from its starting node to the end node as it was processed. After processing each function, the CPU usage on nodes decreased accordingly. Throughout, I meticulously tracked solutions and requests, noting instances where certain edges between node sets were never utilized based on the simplest path. To visualize usage patterns, I graphed each output, highlighting the paths taken. This approach helped in monitoring and optimizing network performance effectively.
