## Week 3 (6/30 - 7/7)

This week, after a planning meeting with Dr. Siasi, I focused on conducting extensive research and formulating a comprehensive plan to execute my project. This process involved exploring various methodologies, technologies, and best practices to ensure the project's success. To refine my approach, I wrote a detailed proposal outlining my research findings, potential strategies, and the next steps for implementation. This effort resulted in a well-defined and strategic roadmap that aligns closely with my project objectives.
