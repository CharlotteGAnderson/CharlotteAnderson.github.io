title: Week 1 (6/17 - 6/23)
---

During my first week on this project, I began laying the foundational pieces by developing a comprehensive network configuration for my advisor. This involved creating a network with various connecting nodes and edges from scratch, which was a new challenge for me. I started by researching the theoretical aspects of network topology and communication protocols. After selecting the appropriate tools, I designed a basic network layout and began the practical task of setting up the nodes and connections. I faced several technical challenges, such as configuring protocols and managing data flow interruptions, which I overcame by consulting online resources. By the end of the week, I had successfully created a functional network model that served as the project's foundation. At the end of this project I will be able to furthur discuss my code.
