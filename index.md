## About Me

Welcome to my website for the Distributed Research Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) program! I'm Charlotte Anderson, currently pursuing a Master’s degree in data science at DePaul University, with an expected graduation in June 2024. My research interests encompass fog computing, machine learning, and computational methods. Through the DREAM program, I am gaining valuable hands-on research experience. Previously, I earned a bachelor’s degree in finance from DePaul University in 2023, where I also gained experience in accounting, corporate finance, and equity research. I seamlessly transitioned to my master's degree immediately after graduating.
